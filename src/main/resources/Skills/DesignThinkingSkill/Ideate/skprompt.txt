{{$input}}

In a JSON format there are two objects labeled "Lower-hanging fruit" and "Higher-hanging fruit".
The "Lower-hanging fruit" object should have an array of 10 ideas for products, programs, or features that should be implemented for cases where any resource requirements are MEDIUM or LOW.
The "Higher-hanging fruit" object should have an array of 10 ideas for products, programs, or features that should be implemented for cases where any resource requirements are HIGH.
The format should read:
[
    { "idea": "Lower-hanging fruit",
        [
            { "sentiment": "expression of a sentiment", "summary": "concise summary of reason for this sentiment"},
            { "sentiment": "expression of a sentiment", "summary": "concise summary of reason for this sentiment"}
        ]
    },
    { "idea": "Higher-hanging fruit",
        [
            { "sentiment": "expression of a sentiment", "summary": "concise summary of reason for this sentiment"},
            { "sentiment": "expression of a sentiment", "summary": "concise summary of reason for this sentiment"}
        ]
    }
